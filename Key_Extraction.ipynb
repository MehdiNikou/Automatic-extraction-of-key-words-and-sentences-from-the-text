       " '” The competition emerged even before we had\\ndelivered our first product',\n",
       " ' What is a small, startup company to do? It doesn’t\\nhave money to compete with the large companies',\n",
       " ' It has to modify its ideas to\\nkeep ahead of the competition and come up with a demonstration that excites\\npotential customers and wows potential investors and, more importantly,\\npotential distributors of the product',\n",
       " ' It is the distributors who are the real\\ncustomers, not the people who eventually buy the product in stores and use it\\nin their homes',\n",
       " ' The example illustrates the real business pressures on\\ncompanies: the need for speed, the concern about costs, the competition that\\nmay force the company to change its offerings, and the need to satisfy several\\nclasses of customers—investors, distributors, and, of course, the people who\\nwill actually use the product',\n",
       " ' Where should the company focus its limited\\nresources? More user studies? Faster development? New, unique features?\\n\\nThe same pressures that the startup faced also impact established companies',\n",
       " '\\nBut they have other pressures as well',\n",
       " ' Most products have a development cycle\\nof one to two years',\n",
       " ' In order to bring out a new model every year, the design\\nprocess for the new model has to have started even before the previous model\\nhas been released to customers',\n",
       " ' Moreover, mechanisms for collecting and feeding\\nback the experiences of customers seldom exist',\n",
       " ' In an earlier era, there was\\nclose coupling between designers and users',\n",
       " ' Today, they are separated by\\nbarriers',\n",
       " ' Some companies prohibit designers from working with customers, a\\nbizarre and senseless restriction',\n",
       " ' Why would they do this? In part to prevent\\nleaks of the new developments to the competition, but also in part because\\ncustomers may  stop purchasing the current offerings if they are led to believe\\nthat a new, more advanced item is soon to come',\n",
       " ' But even where there are no\\nsuch restrictions, the complexity of large organizations coupled with the\\nrelentless pressure to finish the product makes this interaction difficult',\n",
       " '\\nRemember Norman’s Law of Chapter 6: The day a product development process\\nstarts, it is behind schedule and above budget',\n",
       " '\\nFEATURITIS: A DEADLY TEMPTATION',\n",
       " '\\nIn every successful product there lurks the carrier of an insidious disease\\ncalled “featuritis,” with its main symptom being “creeping featurism',\n",
       " '” The\\ndisease seems to have been first identified and named in 1976, but its origins\\nprobably go back to the earliest technologies, buried far back in the eons\\nprior to the dawn of history',\n",
       " ' It seems unavoidable, with no known prevention',\n",
       " '\\nLet me explain',\n",
       " '\\n\\nSuppose we follow all the principles in this book for a wonderful,\\nhuman-centered product',\n",

       " ' As a result, suppose the product is successful: many people buy\\nit and tell their friends to buy it',\n",
       " ' What could be wrong with this?\\n\\nThe problem is that after the product has been available for a while, a number\\nof factors inevitably appear, pushing the company toward the addition of new\\nfeatures—toward creeping featurism',\n",
       " ' These factors include: \\n\\nExisting customers like the product, but express a wish for more features,\\nmore functions, more capability',\n",
       " '\\n\\nA competing company adds new features to its products, producing competitive\\npressures to match that offering, but to do even more in order to get ahead\\nof the competition',\n",
       " '\\n\\nCustomers are satisfied, but sales are declining because the market is\\nsaturated: everyone who wants the product already has it',\n",
       " ' Time to add\\nwonderful enhancements that will cause people to want the new model, to\\nupgrade',\n",
       " '\\n\\nFeaturitis is highly infectious',\n",
       " ' New products are invariably more complex, more\\npowerful, and different in size than the first release of a product',\n",
       " ' You can\\nsee that tension playing out in music players, mobile phones, and computers,\\nespecially on smart phones, tablets, and pads',\n",
       " ' Portable devices get smaller and\\nsmaller with each release, despite the addition of more and more features\\n(making them ever more difficult to operate)',\n",
       " ' Some products, such as\\nautomobiles, home refrigerators, television sets, and kitchen stoves, also\\nincrease in complexity with each release, getting larger and more powerful',\n",
       " '\\n\\nBut whether the products get larger or smaller, each new edition invariably has\\nmore features than the previous one',\n",
       " ' Featuritis is an insidious disease,\\ndifficult to eradicate, impossible to vaccinate against',\n",
       " ' It is easy for\\nmarketing pressures to insist upon the addition of new features, but there is\\nno call—or for that matter, budget—to get rid of old, unneeded ones',\n",
       " '\\n\\nHow do you know when you have encountered featuritis? By its major symptom:\\ncreeping featurism',\n",
       " ' Want an example? Look at Figure 7',\n",
       " '1, which illustrates the\\nchanges that have overcome the simple Lego motorcycle since my first encounter\\nwith it for the first edition of this book',\n",
       " ' The original motorcycle (Figure 4',\n",
       " '1\\nand Figure 7',\n",
       " '1A) had only fifteen components and could be put together without\\nany instructions: it had sufficient constraints that every piece had a unique\\nlocation and orientation',\n",
       " ' But now, as Figure 7',\n",
       " '1B shows, the same motorcycle\\nhas become bloated, with twenty-nine pieces',\n",
       " ' I needed instructions',\n",
       " '\\n\\nCreeping featurism is the tendency to add to the number of features of a\\nproduct, often extending the number beyond all reason',\n",
       " ' There is no way that a\\nproduct can remain usable and understandable by the time it has all of those\\nspecial-purpose features that have been added in over time',\n",
       " '\\n\\nIn her book Different, Harvard professor Youngme Moon argues that it is this\\nattempt to match the competition that causes all products to be the same',\n",
       " ' When\\ncompanies try to increase sales by matching every feature of their competitors,\\nthey end up hurting themselves',\n",
       " ' After all, when products from two companies\\nmatch feature by feature, there is no longer any reason for a customer to\\nprefer one over another',\n",
       " ' This is competition-driven design',\n",
       " ' Unfortunately, the\\nmind-set of matching the competitor’s list of features pervades many\\norganizations',\n",
       " ' Even if the first versions of a product are well done,\\nhuman-centered, and focused upon real needs, it is the rare organization that\\nis content to let a good product stay untouched',\n",
       " '\\n\\nMost companies compare features with their competition to determine where they\\nare weak, so they can strengthen those areas',\n",
       " ' Wrong, argues Moon',\n",
       " ' A better\\nstrategy is to concentrate on areas where they are stronger and to strengthen\\nthem even more',\n",
       " ' Then focus all marketing and advertisements to point out the\\nstrong points',\n",
       " ' This causes the product to stand out from the mindless herd',\n",
       " ' As\\nfor the weaknesses, ignore the irrelevant ones, says Moon',\n",
       " ' The lesson is\\nsimple: don’t follow blindly; focus on strengths, not weaknesses',\n",
       " ' If the\\nproduct has real strengths, it can afford to just be “good enough” in the other\\nareas',\n",
       " '\\n\\nGood design requires stepping back from competitive pressures and ensuring that\\nthe entire product be consistent, coherent, and understandable',\n",
       " ' This stance\\nrequires the leadership of the company to withstand the marketing forces that\\nkeep begging to add this feature or that, each thought to be essential for some\\nmarket segment',\n",
       " ' The best products come from ignoring these competing voices and\\ninstead focusing on the true needs of the people who use the product',\n",
       " '\\n\\nJeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon',\n",

       " '\\nThe competition is ignored, the traditional marketing requirements are ignored',\n",
       " '\\nThe focus is on simple, customer-driven questions: what do the customers want;\\nhow can their needs best be satisfied; what can be done better to enhance\\ncustomer service and customer value? Focus on the customer, Bezos argues, and\\nthe rest takes care of itself',\n",
       " ' Many companies claim to aspire to this\\nphilosophy, but few are able to follow it',\n",
       " ' Usually it is only possible where\\nthe head of the company, the CEO, is also the founder',\n",
       " ' Once the company passes\\ncontrol to others, especially those who follow the traditional MBA dictum of\\nputting profit above customer concerns, the story goes downhill',\n",
       " ' Profits may\\nindeed increase in the short term, but eventually the product quality\\ndeteriorates to the point where customers desert',\n",

       " ' When the dial was replaced with pushbutton keys, it\\nsuffered a slight case of featuritis: the ten positions of the dial were\\nreplaced with twelve keys: the ten digits plus * and #',\n",

       " ' The human computer gave\\nrise to laptops, small portable computers',\n",

       " '” In the\\ntwenty-second century, will we still have phones? I predict that although we\\nwill still talk with one another over a distance, we will not have any device\\ncalled a telephone',\n",
       " '\\n\\nAs the pressures for larger screens forced the demise of physical keyboards\\n(despite the attempt to make tiny keyboards, operated with single fingers or\\nthumbs), the keyboards were displayed on the screen whenever needed, each\\nletter tapped one at a time',\n",

       " ' The example illustrates the real business pressures on companies: the need for speed, the concern about costs, the competition that may force the company to change its offerings, and the need to satisfy several classes of customers—investors, distributors, and, of course, the people who will actually use the product',\n",

       " ' Most products have a development cycle of one to two years',\n",
       " ' In order to bring out a new model every year, the design process for the new model has to have started even before the previous model has been released to customers',\n",

       " ' In an earlier era, there was close coupling between designers and users',\n",

       " ' Some companies prohibit designers from working with customers, a bizarre and senseless restriction',\n",
       " ' Why would they do this? In part to prevent leaks of the new developments to the competition, but also in part because customers may  stop purchasing the current offerings if they are led to believe that a new, more advanced item is soon to come',\n",

       " ' In every successful product there lurks the carrier of an insidious disease called “featuritis,” with its main symptom being “creeping featurism',\n",
       " '” The disease seems to have been first identified and named in 1976, but its origins probably go back to the earliest technologies, buried far back in the eons prior to the dawn of history',\n",
       " ' It seems unavoidable, with no known prevention',\n",
       " ' Let me explain',\n",
       " '  Suppose we follow all the principles in this book for a wonderful, human-centered product',\n",
       " ' It obeys all design principles',\n",
       " ' It overcomes people’s problems and fulfills some important needs',\n",

       " ' As a result, suppose the product is successful: many people buy it and tell their friends to buy it',\n",
       " ' What could be wrong with this?  The problem is that after the product has been available for a while, a number of factors inevitably appear, pushing the company toward the addition of new features—toward creeping featurism',\n",
       " ' These factors include:   Existing customers like the product, but express a wish for more features, more functions, more capability',\n",
       " '  A competing company adds new features to its products, producing competitive pressures to match that offering, but to do even more in order to get ahead of the competition',\n",
       " '  Customers are satisfied, but sales are declining because the market is saturated: everyone who wants the product already has it',\n",
       " ' Time to add wonderful enhancements that will cause people to want the new model, to upgrade',\n",
       " '  Featuritis is highly infectious',\n",
       " ' New products are invariably more complex, more powerful, and different in size than the first release of a product',\n",
       " ' You can see that tension playing out in music players, mobile phones, and computers, especially on smart phones, tablets, and pads',\n",
       " ' Portable devices get smaller and smaller with each release, despite the addition of more and more features (making them ever more difficult to operate)',\n",
       " ' Some products, such as automobiles, home refrigerators, television sets, and kitchen stoves, also increase in complexity with each release, getting larger and more powerful',\n",
       " '  But whether the products get larger or smaller, each new edition invariably has more features than the previous one',\n",
       " ' Featuritis is an insidious disease, difficult to eradicate, impossible to vaccinate against',\n",
       " ' It is easy for marketing pressures to insist upon the addition of new features, but there is no call—or for that matter, budget—to get rid of old, unneeded ones',\n",
       " '  How do you know when you have encountered featuritis? By its major symptom: creeping featurism',\n",
       " ' Want an example? Look at Figure 7',\n",
       " '1, which illustrates the changes that have overcome the simple Lego motorcycle since my first encounter with it for the first edition of this book',\n",
       " ' The original motorcycle (Figure 4',\n",
       " '1 and Figure 7',\n",
       " '1A) had only fifteen components and could be put together without any instructions: it had sufficient constraints that every piece had a unique location and orientation',\n",
       " ' But now, as Figure 7',\n",
       " '1B shows, the same motorcycle has become bloated, with twenty-nine pieces',\n",
       " ' I needed instructions',\n",
       " '  Creeping featurism is the tendency to add to the number of features of a product, often extending the number beyond all reason',\n",
       " ' There is no way that a product can remain usable and understandable by the time it has all of those special-purpose features that have been added in over time',\n",
       " '  In her book Different, Harvard professor Youngme Moon argues that it is this attempt to match the competition that causes all products to be the same',\n",
       " ' When companies try to increase sales by matching every feature of their competitors, they end up hurting themselves',\n",
       " ' After all, when products from two companies match feature by feature, there is no longer any reason for a customer to prefer one over another',\n",
       " ' This is competition-driven design',\n",
       " ' Unfortunately, the mind-set of matching the competitor’s list of features pervades many organizations',\n",
       " ' Even if the first versions of a product are well done, human-centered, and focused upon real needs, it is the rare organization that is content to let a good product stay untouched',\n",
       " '  Most companies compare features with their competition to determine where they are weak, so they can strengthen those areas',\n",
       " ' Wrong, argues Moon',\n",
       " ' A better strategy is to concentrate on areas where they are stronger and to strengthen them even more',\n",
       " ' Then focus all marketing and advertisements to point out the strong points',\n",
       " ' This causes the product to stand out from the mindless herd',\n",
       " ' As for the weaknesses, ignore the irrelevant ones, says Moon',\n",
       " ' The lesson is simple: don’t follow blindly; focus on strengths, not weaknesses',\n",
       " ' If the product has real strengths, it can afford to just be “good enough” in the other areas',\n",
       " '  Good design requires stepping back from competitive pressures and ensuring that the entire product be consistent, coherent, and understandable',\n",
       " ' This stance requires the leadership of the company to withstand the marketing forces that keep begging to add this feature or that, each thought to be essential for some market segment',\n",
       " ' The best products come from ignoring these competing voices and instead focusing on the true needs of the people who use the product',\n",
       " '  Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon',\n",

       " '” Everything is focused upon the requirements of Amazon’s customers',\n",
       " ' The competition is ignored, the traditional marketing requirements are ignored',\n",
       " ' The focus is on simple, customer-driven questions: what do the customers want; how can their needs best be satisfied; what can be done better to enhance customer service and customer value? Focus on the customer, Bezos argues, and the rest takes care of itself',\n",
       " ' Many companies claim to aspire to this philosophy, but few are able to follow it',\n",
       " ' Usually it is only possible where the head of the company, the CEO, is also the founder',\n",
       " ' Once the company passes control to others, especially those who follow the traditional MBA dictum of putting profit above customer concerns, the story goes downhill',\n",
       " ' Profits may indeed increase in the short term, but eventually the product quality deteriorates to the point where customers desert',\n",
       " ' Quality only comes about by continual focus on, and attention to, the people who matter: customers',\n",

       " '  Consider the four products shown in Figure 7',\n",
       " '2',\n",
       " ' Their appearance and methods of operations changed radically in their century of existence',\n",
       " ' Early telephones, such as the one in Figure 7',\n",
       " '2A, did not have keyboards: a human operator intervened to make the connections',\n",
       " ' Even when operators were first replaced by automatic switching systems, the “keyboard” was a rotary dial with ten holes, one for each digit',\n",
       " ' When the dial was replaced with pushbutton keys, it suffered a slight case of featuritis: the ten positions of the dial were replaced with twelve keys: the ten digits plus * and #',\n",
       " '  But much more interesting is the merger of devices',\n",
       " ' The human computer gave rise to laptops, small portable computers',\n",
       " ' The telephone moved to small, portable cellular phones (called mobiles in much of the world)',\n",
       " ' Smart phones had large, touch-sensitive screens, operated by gesture',\n",
       " ' Soon computers merged into tablets, as did cell phones',\n",
       " ' Cameras merged with cell phones',\n",
       " ' Today, talking, video conferences, writing, photography (both still and video), and collaborative interaction of all sorts are increasingly  being done by one single device, available with a large variety of screen sizes, computational power, and portability',\n",
       " ' It doesn’t make sense to call them computers, phones, or cameras: we need a new name',\n",
       " ' Let’s call them “smart screens',\n",
       " '” In the twenty-second century, will we still have phones? I predict that although we will still talk with one another over a distance, we will not have any device called a telephone',\n",
       " '  As the pressures for larger screens forced the demise of physical keyboards (despite the attempt to make tiny keyboards, operated with single fingers or thumbs), the keyboards were displayed on the screen whenever needed, each letter tapped one at a time',\n",
       " ' This is slow, even when the system tries to predict the word being typed so that keying can stop as soon as the correct word shows up',\n",
       " ' Several systems were soon developed that allowed the finger or stylus to trace a path among the letters of the word: word-gesture systems',\n",
       " ' The gestures were sufficiently different from one another that it wasn’t even necessary to touch all the letters—it only mattered that the pattern generated by the approximation to the correct path was close enough to the desired one',\n",

       " '  With gesture-based systems, a major rethinking is possible',\n",
       " ' Why keep the letters in the same QWERTY arrangement? The pattern generation would be even faster if letters were rearranged to maximize speed when using a single finger or stylus to trace out the letters',\n",

       " ' Some people will prefer to speak their ideas, dictating them',\n",
       " ' But spoken words are still likely to be turned into printed words (even if the print is simply on a display device), because reading is far faster and superior to listening',\n",
       " ' Reading can be done quickly: it is possible to read around three hundred words per minute and to skim, jumping ahead and back, effectively acquiring information at rates in the thousands of words per minute',\n",
       " ' Listening is slow and serial, usually at around sixty words per minute, and although this rate can be doubled or tripled with speech compression technologies and training, it is still slower than reading and not easy to skim',\n",
       " ' But the new media and new technologies will supplement the old, so that writing will no longer dominate as much as it did in the past, when it was the only medium widely available',\n",

What will be the role of technology in our lives, for the future of books, and what are the moral obligations of the design profession? And finally, for how long will the principles in this book remain relevant? It should be no surprise that I believe they will always be just as relevant as they were twenty-five years ago, just as relevant as they are today\n",
      "Rank 20:  Why would they do this? In part to prevent leaks of the new developments to the competition, but also in part because customers may  stop purchasing the current offerings if they are led to believe that a new, more advanced item is soon to come\n",

      "Rank 60:  As a result, suppose the product is successful: many people buy it and tell their friends to buy it\n",
      "Rank 61:   Most companies compare features with their competition to determine where they are weak, so they can strengthen those areas\n",
      "Rank 62:  In every successful product there lurks the carrier of an insidious disease called “featuritis,” with its main symptom being “creeping featurism\n",
      "Rank 63:  Quality only comes about by continual focus on, and attention to, the people who matter: customers\n",

      "Rank 68:   As the pressures for larger screens forced the demise of physical keyboards (despite the attempt to make tiny keyboards, operated with single fingers or thumbs), the keyboards were displayed on the screen whenever needed, each letter tapped one at a time\n",
      "Rank 69:  What is a small, startup company to do? It doesn’t have money to compete with the large companies\n",
      "Rank 70:  Some products, such as automobiles, home refrigerators, television sets, and kitchen stoves, also increase in complexity with each release, getting larger and more powerful\n",

      "Rank 72:  The founders had some unique ideas, pushing the technology of cooking far ahead of anything available for homes\n",
      "Rank 73:  Portable devices get smaller and smaller with each release, despite the addition of more and more features (making them ever more difficult to operate)\n",
      "Rank 74:  Even relatively stable home products, such as automobiles, kitchen appliances, television sets, and computers, face the multiple forces of a competitive market that encourage the introduction of changes without sufficient testing and refinement\n",
      "Rank 75:  But just as we were about to commission the first production of a few hand-tooled working prototypes that could be shown to potential investors and customers (an expensive proposition for the small self-funded company), other companies started displaying similar concepts in the trade shows\n",

      "Rank 83:  After all, there are only a few basic ways by which a manufacturer can compete: three of the most important being price, features, and quality—unfortunately often in that order of importance\n",
      "Rank 84:  We modified the original product concept several times, based on early feedback from potential users and advice from industry experts\n",

      "Rank 94:  Some people will prefer to speak their ideas, dictating them\n",
      "Rank 95:  This stance requires the leadership of the company to withstand the marketing forces that keep begging to add this feature or that, each thought to be essential for some market segment\n",
      "Rank 96:  People knew QWERTY and balked at having to learn a different organization\n",
